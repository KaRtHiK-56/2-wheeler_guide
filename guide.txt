BUYING GUIDE:

Highlights:
Comfort is King: A bike that complements your body size and riding posture is essential for long rides and confident handling. 
Choose the Right Size/Weight: For beginners, consider motorcycles in the 450cc to 650cc range. 
Consider Your Riding Needs: Whether you crave daily commutes, weekend getaways, or adventurous journeys, match your riding style with the appropriate motorcycle type.


Well, then this comprehensive guide will equip you with all the knowledge you need to choose the perfect motorcycle for your adventures. We'll go beyond just brand names to explore the essential factors that truly matter, ensuring a comfortable, safe, and thrilling ride.



Importance Considerations Before Buying
Before entering the world of motorcycle specs and chrome, take a moment to consider your riding style and needs. This self-evaluation will be your compass, guiding you toward the perfect bike that enhances your riding goals.



Are you a city commuter looking for a reliable daily commuter bike?


Perhaps a lightweight, fuel-efficient motorcycle like a standard or "naked" bike would be ideal for navigating city streets and squeezing through traffic. 



Are you an explorer of new routes?


A versatile all-rounder or sport-touring motorcycle might be your perfect partner. These bikes offer a comfortable riding position and enough power for highway cruising, while still being manageable for twisty roads.



For the adventurous spirit, the call of the open road might be loudest. 


Adventure touring motorcycles, built for tackling rough terrain and long distances, could be your ideal choice. These bikes prioritize comfort and practicality, with features like luggage racks and wind protection for extended journeys.



Cruisers, known for their relaxed riding position and laid-back attitude, are perfect for cruising in style. However, their heavier weight and bulkier design might not be the best fit for new riders or those navigating tight city streets.



Sportbikes, designed for speed and agility, are best suited for experienced riders who plan to hit the racetrack. Their aggressive riding position can be tiring for everyday use, and their high-performance nature requires a skilled rider for safe handling.



Remember, this is just a starting point. Many motorcycle types offer variations and subcategories that might perfectly suit your needs. Don't be afraid to explore different options and consider test rides to find the bike that speaks to your riding soul!



Ergonomics Come First – Comfort is King
Now that you have a better understanding of your riding style, let's shift gears to another crucial factor: ergonomics. Unlike a car where you can adjust your seat and steering wheel, a motorcycle's ergonomics are largely fixed. Choosing a bike that complements your body size and riding posture is key to long-term comfort and safety. 



Imagine spending hours on a motorcycle that forces you into a cramped or awkward position. Not only will it be uncomfortable, but it can also lead to fatigue, muscle strain, and even decreased control over the bike.  



Here's where understanding key ergonomic factors comes in:


Seat Height: You should be able to comfortably place both feet flat on the ground when seated on the bike. This provides stability and confidence, especially when starting and stopping. 
Handlebar Reach: The handlebar should allow for a relaxed, upright posture without excessive leaning forward or reaching. This reduces strain on your back, shoulders, and arms. 
Footpeg Position: Your knees should have a slight bend when seated, avoiding a cramped or overly extended position. This ensures proper control and manoeuvrability. 


Keeping these factors in mind, beginner-friendly motorcycles like commuters or "naked" bikes often shine. Their upright seating position, comfortable seats, and mid-set handlebars promote a neutral and relaxed posture, ideal for long rides and navigating city streets.



On the other hand, sportbikes, while undeniably thrilling, might not be the best first choice for beginners. Their aggressive, forward-leaning riding posture can put a strain on your wrists, back, and neck. Their high-mounted footpegs can also make it difficult to comfortably place both feet flat on the ground. 



Remember, comfort is key to enjoying your motorcycle experience. Choose a bike that allows you to ride with confidence and control, setting the foundation for a lifetime of motorcycle adventures!



Matching Your Strength – Weight & Maneuverability 
Now that we've addressed comfort and ergonomics, let's talk about another crucial factor for new riders: weight and manoeuvrability. A motorcycle's weight plays a significant role in how easily you can handle it, especially at lower speeds where accidents are more common. 



Imagine navigating a tight parking lot or manoeuvring through city traffic on a heavyweight motorcycle. It can feel cumbersome and intimidating, potentially leading to situations where you lose control.



For beginner riders, a lighter motorcycle translates to easier handling and increased confidence. You'll be able to practice manoeuvring, braking, and turning with more control, building a strong foundation for your riding skills.



So, what's a suitable weight range for beginners? A good rule of thumb is to consider motorcycles in the 450cc to 650cc engine range. These bikes offer a good balance between power and weight, providing enough acceleration for confident highway riding while remaining manageable for manoeuvring and navigating city streets.



Of course, engine size isn't the only factor. Consider the overall weight of the motorcycle, including features like fairings and luggage racks. Remember, you'll also be pushing the bike around in parking lots and garages, so a manageable weight is key.



Don't be afraid to visit dealerships and test-ride different motorcycles. Get a feel for their weight and how they handle it at low speeds. This hands-on experience will be invaluable in helping you choose a bike that feels comfortable and manageable for your strength and experience level.



Beyond the Basics – Essential Specs to Consider 
We've covered some key factors to prioritize when choosing your first motorcycle, but there are additional specifications worth considering for a well-rounded riding experience. Here are some essentials to keep in mind:



Engine Size: As discussed earlier, engine size plays a role in both power and weight. For beginners, a 450cc to 650cc range offers a good balance. However, if you plan for highway cruising or two-up riding, a slightly larger engine might be suitable. Remember, horsepower is exciting, but for beginners, controllable power is key. 
Braking Power: Safe and reliable braking is paramount. Look for motorcycles with disc brakes on both the front and rear wheels. Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS) are highly recommended, especially for new riders, as they prevent wheel lockup during hard braking, offering greater control in emergencies. 
Fuel Efficiency: Consider your riding habits and budget. Commuter motorcycles tend to be more fuel-efficient, and ideal for frequent riders or those on a tight budget. While larger engines might offer more power, they typically consume more fuel.
Maintenance Costs: Every motorcycle requires regular maintenance. Research the service intervals and typical maintenance costs for different models. This will help you factor in the long-term ownership cost and choose a bike that fits your budget.


Remember, these specifications are all interconnected. A larger engine might offer more power but might also be less fuel-efficient and have higher maintenance costs.



By considering these factors alongside your riding needs and budget, you'll be well on your way to selecting a motorcycle that's not only comfortable and manageable but also delivers a safe, enjoyable, and fuel-efficient riding experience.



Additional Considerations 
While we've focused on crucial factors for a safe and enjoyable riding experience, here are two additional points to consider:



Resale Value: While resale value can be a factor, it shouldn't be the top priority for beginners. Focus on finding a motorcycle that prioritizes your comfort, safety, and riding style. The right bike will bring you joy and equip you with the skills to confidently navigate the world of motorcycles. When the time comes to upgrade, you'll be in a better position to choose a bike that suits your evolving needs and riding experience.  
Spare Parts Availability & Maintenance Costs: For long-term ownership, consider the availability of spare parts and the affordability of maintenance for your chosen motorcycle. Popular models typically have readily available parts at dealerships and repair shops. Researching maintenance schedules and typical service costs will help you factor in the long-term financial commitment of owning a motorcycle.


Bonus Tip: The Power of a Test Ride! 
Before finalizing your decision, take advantage of test rides offered by dealerships. This is your chance to experience the motorcycle firsthand. See how it feels at low speeds, assess the ergonomics, and get a sense of its power and handling. A test ride can be an eye-opener, helping you confirm if a particular motorcycle truly complements your riding style and comfort preferences. 



Ready to Hit the Road?
Remember, the key takeaways for choosing your first bike are prioritizing comfort, ergonomics, and a manageable weight. 



Don't forget the power of research! Read reviews, compare specifications, and explore online resources to narrow down your options. 


10 factors to consider:
1:THE LEVEL OF AGES – Experience Counts
We all have different riding styles, some love knee scraping around the sharp turns of roads, and some are afraid of it. Possibly, that’s the level of experience which differentiates the two kinds of riders: the inexperienced and experienced rider. As expected in some topsy-turvy examples, the inexperienced ones are those who are unable to make the most of their B.I.G. machine’s power, by finding them difficult to handle their power, while improper maneuvering from one point to another. In contrast to it, an experienced biker can find the puny motorcycles not up to the mark of his riding skills and the hunger of power he always has in his soul. These topsy-turvy situations can lead to the disrespect of the machines. Thus, the years, minutes and seconds spent on the bike make you realize how skilled you are, as a rider. So if you are new to motorcycles and want to optimize your skills as a professional rider, prefer the commuters or entry-level sportsbikes (125-150cc bikes in the Indian context) at the initial level which have a good symphony of handling and ride quality, and then follow a bottom-to-top approach by following the order of 200/250cc-500/600cc-1000cc or above. But be sure you have your hands set on the segment before you upgrade to the next level, as this may lead to inefficiencies. In India, we have bikes like Honda CBF-Stunner, Yamaha YZF-R15, KTM Duke 200, etc. which help you to bring out the rider from your inside, through their One Make Championships. Remember, it’s the game of need for speed, and you have to earn the proper bounties for it! And one more thing – avoid scooters for gaining proficiency. They are not going to help you mature you as a pro-riderWe all have different riding styles, some love knee scraping around the sharp turns of roads, and some are afraid of it.

They are not going to help you mature you as a pro-rider

2:WHERE TO RIDE – The whole world is the playground?
Normally, sometimes it’s the area of your residence which can make you realize what kind of ride you should prefer there. You cannot take a liter-class or street-fighters, built-for-track superbike in desert trails. Most of the motorcycles are designed to be ridden primarily on the tarred roads. However, there are certain bikes which are designed to be extensively ridden on dirt terrains and rugged trails as wells as on the normal paved conditions. And this makes me think of the Royal Enfields & Hero Impulse and the mountains of Laddakh, ehh!

3:Body Type – The style of your ride
Imagine a world full of similar-sized human beings, either all of them muscular hunks, or lean thin broomsticks or potato lovers! And the consequences can be a monotonous caste. Same for the case of motorcycles, there are different types of two-wheeled machines which let you know that the world of bikes has a lot to offer for all the tastes. The various body types of motorcycles are:-

Cruisers – In these, your feet are placed forward and hands at or above the chest level, giving the rider an upright or slightly leaned back seating position. In short, these are the sofa incarnated as motorcycle, designed for very long highway jaunts. Eg – Bajaj Avenger DTS-I, Royal Enfield Thunderbird.
Sport bikes – In these, the seating position is in its aggressive mood, with the leaned over riding position, where the handlebars are below the rider’s chest, elbows are kept straight and feet are tucked beneath or behind the body, making an acute angle with your thighs. These are designed for committed track rides, to make the most of you around sharp corners and fast lanes. Eg – Yamaha YZF-R15, Kawasaki Ninja 300.
Tourer – In these, the seating position is a mixed bag of a cruiser and a sport bike, with a bit more erected riding position and feet placed not so far behind. These are specially designed for those looking out for comfortable long distance rides. Eg – Yamaha Fazer, Hero Karizma R.
Street bikes – In this, the riding position is an amalgamation of a sport bike and tourer, with a bit more erect riding position that can be more comfortable for short and slick traffic rides. These belong to the most comprehensive category, ranging from basic commuters to super-powerful beasts. Eg – Bajaj Discover 100T, Honda CB 1000R.
Dual Purpose/Dirt bikes – These bikes have riding position similar to those of standard naked street fighters, but with a slightly raised saddle height to accommodate the additional suspension travel. Eg – Hero Impulse, Ducati Hypermotard At the end of the day, the kilometers in your bike’s odometer are the replica of how much sweat you exhausted out of your body. For long distances, tourers and cruisers are the best bet for your money and for short city flicks, street fighters are value worth of your hard-spent cash.

4:FREQUENCY OF USE – The life till the last breath
So if you think that the Thousands of rupees you are spending for buying a motorcycle is the last cash you bill for your ride, you must be kidding. As you require regular health checks for remaining fit, your bike too needs frequent maintenance checks for being in its tune of energy. And for this, service costs too are counted, which are largely determined by how many kilometers your odometer counts at the end of the day. If your daily commutes are more than the number of assignments an engineering student does in his single semester, then you must select a bike that doesn’t require frequent internal services. A valve adjustment can be done every 4000 kms or 25000 kms, depending on the built, size and cubic capacity of your bike - the larger they are, the deeper hole they burn in your pockets for their periodic maintenance. But if your monthly commutes are less than the present fuel rates, then the maintenance costs may not be an important factor when finding the right bike for your needs.

5: ENGINE DISPLACEMENT – Or should I say, fuel efficiency?
It’s the result of varying needs of different riders, that we have an extensive range of motorcycles ranging from 100cc to even 2000cc. This factor cannot be denied, after all, it’s the volume of your engine’s cylinder, which determines the amount of power it liberates to make you feel liberated. In the words of a Layman, the larger the engine displacement, the more power it will produce. This brings out the biggest inversely proportional theorem of the world of motorcycles. The more power a bike produce, the lesser fuel efficient it is. So, decide what your priority is – Power? Increase the hunger of cubic capacity. Fuel Efficiency? Decrease the thirst of that same cubic capacity.

6:RIDER’S PHYSIQUE – Size matters
There is a big considerable visual difference when you see a stout guy riding a puny 100cc commuter and a thin lean lad riding a muscular chopper.. Some bikes may be too tall for your feet to comfortably reach the tank pavement when stopped. Others may be too small to ride comfortably for an extended period of time. The physical size plays an important role in finding the bike that fits right for the size of a rider.  So, if you want to match the macho of the bike you ride, better buy the motorcycle which is in league with your personality and bike’s ergonomics, which includes your height and built of your bulk.

7: NEW OR USED – Which one is more economical?
It’s always a precious moment for every person to buy his first set of wheels. But what’s more precious is the cheque which they sign for buying it. So, the first question which arises in their mind is – Which one is a cheaper deal? A brand new bike out of showroom or a trusted used one in a good condition, but a lesser price. Both have advantages of their own. New bikes have the latest features and cutting-edge tech-laden packaging, and come with a manufacturer warranty. Also, they do qualify for special financing and parts and after-sales service are often readily available. However, they cost much more than used bikes by a fair margin and may be more expensive to insure. On the other hand, used bikes are great for a newbie rider who has a risk of damaging the machine while in his maturing period as a rider, as they are already though vulnerable, offer a great value. Though, one may not be assured about the extent of care previous owner took of that motorcycle, and replacement parts may be more difficult to find. But preferably, for a better value for money proposition, a new machine definitely comes up with more and much better plus points.

8:Ride Quality and practical usage – the real comfort zone
Normally, these are the real criteria which define the line between motorcycle and scooters. The two wheelers are confined to these two body styles on the root level. Talking about the motorcycles, they do are a much better handling machines than scooters and offer you better power and torque figures, keeping the engine configurations same, thanks to the better gearing in motorcycles. On the other hand, scooters seem to be a practical buy, which offer you better ride quality and practical usage with their footboards, which while carrying the additional luggage, can prevent you from the mud splashes during monsoons and capacious under seat storage for carrying that extra stuff, besides being easy to ride with their usually gearless trannys. So, if you are a shopaholic who needs to buy groceries while returning from his/her daily office commutes or beauty parlor, scooters make a preferable choice, and if you want to explore the engine on which your machine runs  and want it to throw around corners, motorcycles do come out as a better option.

9: MODE OF PAYMENT – The real deal sealer:-
When we are out to buy a bike for ourselves, we do really are concerned about the way the manufacturer manages to take the pay of the hard-work it undergoes. For those whose bank balances are wealthier, they can pay the whole amount in cash, or there is an option for the ‘aam aadmi’ to choose from a variety of financing options offered through registered banks and finance lenders, or in some cases, manufacturer itself giving you the loan facilities. However, the paying of the whole MRP of your bike at once is a better value, considering the extra amount of cash you spent in as the interests. But, for some, it’s just the matter of financial boundations which they find a profit with.

10:PARTS AND ACCESSORIES – the extra bells and whistles:-
We all love going beauty parlors, or adorning ourselves with some glitzy tattoos and piercings, as they are our modes of enhancing our charisma. Similarly, one of the greatest things about owning a motorcycle is the ability to customize it to match your riding needs and personalities. Just a visit to the car accessories market nearby your home, and you will get aware about the endless opportunities to accessorize your new motorcycle, with one limited only by his imagination. Common accessories which are worth spending your extra dough in pocket are – windscreen, backrest, custom exhaust, saddlebags and better illuminative lights. Often these accessories can be financed and installed at the same time of purchase, but they always can be added at a later date. But the quality of such parts should be kept in check, or else one second, one part is enough to deteriorate your bike’s ability for ever.
